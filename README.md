# Wireless Helper

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrerinas.wirelesshelper'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png' width="200"/></a>

A lightweight launcher utility for **Headunit Revived**.

This app acts as a trigger to start Android Auto Wireless on your phone. It automatically detects your tablet running Headunit Revived via NSD (mDNS) or a passive TCP trigger, ensuring a seamless wireless connection experience.

## Features
- **Auto-Trigger:** Fires the Android Auto wireless intent as soon as the Headunit is detected.
- **NSD Support:** Finds your tablet in the same WiFi network automatically.
- **Passive Mode:** Waits for a trigger from the Headunit (ideal for Tablet-Hotspot setups).
- **Zero-Config:** No manual IP entry required.

## Auto-Start Setup
To ensure reliable background auto-start (Bluetooth/WiFi) and a stable connection:
1. **Disable Battery Optimization (CRITICAL):** Go to App Info -> Battery -> select **"Unrestricted"**. Since this app acts as a data proxy for Android Auto, it must not be put to sleep while driving.
2. **Permissions:** Grant Bluetooth and Location permissions when prompted.
3. **Paired Devices:** Select your car's Bluetooth device in the settings.

## Automation (Tasker / MacroDroid / ADB)
Wireless Helper supports remote control via Android Intents and App Shortcuts.
